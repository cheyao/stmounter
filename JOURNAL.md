I've researched a toooon about the usb c shield connection: resistor cap pair, ferrite bear, no conenction, connect directly etc. Figured that the best way to connect it is directly to a gnd pour.

Also started designing the schematic!

Decided on a raspi pico form factor because why not ;p It'll be a drop-in replacement.
