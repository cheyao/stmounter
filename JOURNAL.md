# Stmounter

Damn I can't think of a better name >.<

-------------------

## 23/05

But I've started the schematic! Progress looking quite good right now. The stm32 looks like an easy chip.

- Time spent: 1h

## 24/05

I've researched a toooon about the usb c shield connection: resistor cap pair, ferrite bear, no conenction, connect directly etc. Figured that the best way to connect it is directly to a gnd pour.

Also started designing the schematic!

- 2h

-------------------

Decided on a raspi pico form factor because why not ;p It'll be a drop-in replacement.

- 1.5h

-------------------

Finally found a stm32 [getting started manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/cd00164185-getting-started-with-stm32f10xxx-hardware-development-stmicroelectronics.pdf)! This will make my like easier ;p

Only 29 pages tho, how little.

- 2h

-------------------

Okay I've opened like 4 pdfs now, in datasheet hell... Welp this is easier then my fpga though. Calculating oscillator capacitance rn.

I've calculated the capacitance and continued routing:
